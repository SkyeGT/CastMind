## 🧠 Overview

CastMind is an **interaction-driven agentic reasoning** framework for time series forecasting. Instead of treating forecasting as a static, one-shot regression task, CastMind models it as an expert-like, multi-turn process powered by **training-free LLMs**. It organizes inference into a three-stage workflow: **(1) context extraction** (features, knowledge, attributes, and case-based references), **(2) reasoning-based generation** (produce an intermediate forecast with evidence-grounded adjustments), and **(3) reflective evaluation and refinement** (contract/evidence checks with iterative correction and a fallback strategy when needed). To support reliable reasoning, CastMind provides a lightweight toolkit including a **feature set**, **knowledge base**, **contextual pool**, and **case library**.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Interaction-Driven, Multi-Stage Inference**: Reformulates forecasting from one-shot prediction into a three-stage pipeline (context extraction → reasoning-based generation → reflective evaluation & refinement) for iterative, expert-like forecasting.

- **Evidence-Grounded Context Construction**: Builds a consolidated context from task/data profiles, timestamps, endogenous/exogenous sequences, selected temporal features, retrieved knowledge, case-based references, and supplementary context.

- **Lightweight Toolkit for Reasoning Support**: Provides a modular toolkit (feature set, knowledge base, contextual pool, and case library) that supplies external evidence without model training.


- **Reflective Verification with Fallback**: Performs checks to reduce unsupported adjustments and iteratively refine forecasts.

## 🚀 Easy Experiments


To quickly reproduce our experiments, follow these simple steps:

1. **Prepare environment & data**
   - Set up all checkpoints for deep learning models and foundation models.
   - Set up your data folder.

2. **Create and activate conda environment**

```bash
conda create -n castmind python=3.9 -y
conda activate castmind
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run experiments**

```bash
python run_experiment.py
```

## 🧪 Experimental Results

CastMind consistently achieves the best performance across most datasets, demonstrating a significant advantage over statistical baselines, recent deep learning models, and foundation models. The following figure presents its experimental results in both short-term and long-term forecasting.
